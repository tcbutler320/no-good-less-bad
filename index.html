Welcome to my academic website! Here you can find updates on my academic work, security research, and blog entries on information security. I'm currently a graduate student at Georgetown University in the <a href="https://css.georgetown.edu/">Security Studies Program (SSP)</a> at the <a href="https://sfs.georgetown.edu/">Walsh School of Foreign Service (SFS)</a>. My focus is on the intersection of emerging technology and national security, with an anticipated certificate in <a href="https://ceres.georgetown.edu/">Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies (CERES)</a>. Prior to studying at Georgetown, I obtained my undergraduate degree in <a href="https://ist.psu.edu/prospective/undergraduate/academics/sra">Security and Risk Analysis</a> at The Pennsylvania State University.

<h2> Information Security </h2>

<p>
In my professional work, I've helped to secure client networks as a cyber risk consultant and penetration tester in Deloitte's Government & Public Services <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/public-sector/solutions/federal-cyber-risk-services.html">Cybersecurity Practice</a>. In my free time, I conduct freelance research to identify vulnerabilities in software and coordinate disclosures with vendors to mitigate risk. Over the years, I've disclosed dozens of vulnerabilities in open-source projects, web applications, and IoT or embedded devices, culminating in several common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs). Some of my most recent research includes <a href="https://support.avigilon.com/s/feed/0D54y00006l9eCMCAY?language=en_US">CVE-2021-38701</a>, <a hef="https://tbutler.org/2021/04/29/hp-officejet-4630">CVE-2021-3441</a>,  <a href="https://tbutler.org/2021/06/28/cve-2021-35956">CVE-2021-35956</a>, and a nomination to the <a href="https://www.motorolasolutions.com/en_us/about/security-vulnerability/hall-of-fame.html">2021 Motorolasolutions Bug Bounty Hall of Fame</a>.

</p>

<h2> Open-Source Software </h2>

I maintain a number of open-source projects on <a href="https://github.com/tcbutler320">GitHub</a>, most of which are security testing frameworks, vulnerability scanning and mitigation tools, or proof of concept exploits. Some of my most recent projects include <a href="https://github.com/tcbutler320/CVE-2021-3441-check">CVE-2021-3441-check</a>â€”a python tool to scan for indicators of compromise for CVE-2021-3441.
