Welcome to my academic website! Here you can find updates on my academic work, security research, and blog entries on information security. I'm currently a graduate student at Georgetown University in the <a href="https://css.georgetown.edu/">Security Studies Program (SSP)</a> at the <a href="https://sfs.georgetown.edu/">Walsh School of Foreign Service (SFS)</a>. My focus is on the intersection of emerging technology and national security, with an anticipated certificate in <a href="https://ceres.georgetown.edu/">Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies (CERES)</a>. Prior to studying at Georgetown, I obtained my undergraduate degree in <a href="https://ist.psu.edu/prospective/undergraduate/academics/sra">Security and Risk Analysis</a> at The Pennsylvania State University.

<h2> Vulnerability Research </h2>

<p>
In addition to my academic work, I conduct freelance research to identify vulnerabilities in software and coordinate disclosures with vendors to mitigate risk. Over the years, I've disclosed dozens of vulnerabilities in open-source projects, web applications, and IoT or embedded devices, culminating in several common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs). Some of my most recent research includes <a href="https://support.avigilon.com/s/feed/0D54y00006l9eCMCAY?language=en_US">CVE-2021-38701</a>, <a hef="https://tbutler.org/2021/04/29/hp-officejet-4630">CVE-2021-3441</a>, and <a href="https://tbutler.org/2021/06/28/cve-2021-35956">CVE-2021-35956</a>.
