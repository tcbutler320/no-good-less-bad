Welcome to my academic website! Here you can find updates on my academic work, information security research, and blog articles. I'm currently a graduate student at Georgetown University in the <a href="https://css.georgetown.edu/">Security Studies Program (SSP)</a> at the <a href="https://sfs.georgetown.edu/">Walsh School of Foreign Service (SFS)</a>. My academic interests are on the intersection of emerging technology and national security, with a specific focus on state-sponsored cyber network operations and cyber operations policy. In addition to my SSP coursework, I'm working towards a certificate in Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies as part of the <a href="https://ceres.georgetown.edu/">CERES</a> certification program. Prior to studying at Georgetown, I obtained my undergraduate degree in <a href="https://ist.psu.edu/prospective/undergraduate/academics/sra">Security and Risk Analysis</a> at The Pennsylvania State University, where I focused on cyber risk management also was on the Competitive Cyber Security Organization.

<h2> Information Security </h2>

<p>
In my professional career I've helped to secure client networks as a cyber risk consultant and penetration tester, and to build modern information systems as a mainframe application developer in Deloitte's Government & Public Services (GPS) practice. In my free time, I develop my vulnerability discovery and exploit development skills through freelance security research and bug bounty programs. Since 2018, I've had the opportunity to engaged dozens of vendors in responsible disclosures for vulnerabilities in open-source projects, web applications, IoT, and embedded devices, culminating in several common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs). Some of my most recent research includes <a href="https://support.avigilon.com/s/feed/0D54y00006l9eCMCAY?language=en_US">CVE-2021-38701</a>, <a hef="https://tbutler.org/2021/04/29/hp-officejet-4630">CVE-2021-3441</a>,  <a href="https://tbutler.org/2021/06/28/cve-2021-35956">CVE-2021-35956</a>. More of my vulnerability research can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/tcbutler320">Github</a>.

<h2> Open-Source Software </h2>

I maintain a number of open-source projects on <a href="https://github.com/tcbutler320">GitHub</a>, most of which are security testing frameworks, vulnerability scanning and mitigation tools, or proof of concept exploits.
